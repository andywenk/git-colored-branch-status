git-colored-branch-status
=========================

Shows the branch name and colors based on the current git branch status

* red --> dirty (untracked or modified files)
* green --> clean
* yellow --> semi-dirty, clean branch but unpushed commits

Copied some code from the .bashrc, because login didn't worked.

## Color adjustment
